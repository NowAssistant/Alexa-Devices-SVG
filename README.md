# Alexa Devices SVGs

Our marketing department made these Alexa devices as vector graphics as we didn't find any usable frames elsewhere on the web. It took us quite a while, so we wanted to share these with other designer that might find them useful.

# How to use these
Just download the repo to your local hard drive and use the SVGs wherever you desire. Even though a backlink to our [website](www.adenin.com) isn't necessary, we for sure would apprecciate it.

# Wanna know why we made these?
We have a cool Digital Assistant for businesses called [Now Assistant](www.nowassistant.com) and that integrates with other smart assistant devices, among them an [Alexa for business integration](https://www.adenin.com/now-assistant/features/alexa-for-business/). Hence we made these device frames. :-)
